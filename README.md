# Revisit Stingers
Lethal Company plugin.

The interiors in Lethal Company each have a unique "stinger" track that plays the first time you enter it.

These stingers only play one time EVER unless you completely reset your save file, which is a shame, because they are quite atmospheric.

This is a simple plugin that will allow the stingers to replay when you encounter the interior somewhere it doesn't normally generate (ex: manor on Experimentation, factory on Rend; chance of "interior swap" is <5% for most moons)

This behavior currently does not occur on Titan or Artifice, which each have a roughly ~20% chance to have an inverted interior. (If it were so frequent, it wouldn't feel as special.)
